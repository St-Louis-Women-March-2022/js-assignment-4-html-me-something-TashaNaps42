            <h2>My World Before Meditation</h2>
            <section>
               <h3>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</h3>
               <p>
                  I won't get too detailed, but let's just say I am not an outlier for the generation that grew up with the Internet.
                  Everything was at our fingertips, all the information good and bad, from a pretty early age. Having access to all that information - 
                  learning about some pretty crazy, real things - while we were developing was a double-edged sword. With the whole world accessible, at least
                  the world through the lense of our cultural biases, we bit off more reality than we could chew. There were loads of stories of people
                  finding something they wish they hadn't; many of us "saw things we couldn't unsee". Besides all that, we learned about the complex
                  geopolitical state of our world. We also had to experience massive cultural shifts as people from every country could now communicate. Now
                  people talked about how America affected their country, or we could hear directly from those with food and water scarcity.
                  This all happened at the same time as high school,
                  an already difficult time. At this time people build an identity and learn their place in their community.

            <section>
               <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
               <p>
                  Needless to say, in this complex and information-dense world, I was looking for "myself", and how I fit in to that massive narrative.
                  I really connected with politics, and ended up using my beliefs to try to answer the problems that I was aware of. I thought that answers
                  could come from our minds, our thinking, and we could build a utopia if we were just educated enough. If we could just try a different
                  social/economic/political system. If I could push back hard enough against the powers that be, or if people would all just believe the same
                  thing, we could finally be happy!
               </p>
               <p>
                  The problem with that theory, and the reason I was so depressed by it, is that it's always somewhere else. Happiness, that is, only happens at
                  some future moment. If it can only happen in the future, then it will never be in the present. How many years would that model take? How long
                  before everyone thinks the same? How long before the electoral college is fixed? How long before there's no more racism, homophobia, transphobia,
                  hate? It's not a timeline any of us know, so in this moment it doesn't exist.

               <h3>Falling Dominoes</h3>
               <p>
                  I felt a lot of fear, every day, about those big problems that I had no power over. I was constantly thinking about how we could fix this imperfect
                  world. Then one day, my friend Seth came over and told me "I think it would be a lot easier to get everyone thinking like I do right now, than
                  to force the world to change". My friend Seth was referring to a state of non-identity with their mind <a href="#annanta">[1]</a> and using 
                  meditation to let go of the need for perfection. Seth had an experience and had learned a bit about meditation through one of my favorte speakers,
                  Ram Dass. They lent me the book, <em>Remember, Be Here Now</em>, which has been my favorite since. I had this moment during that conversation; the feeling
                  was that I was sort of pretending, and that while it was important to help others and participate in life, I felt less stuck inside my mind and
                  my narrative

            <h2>What Meditation Really Is</h2>
            <section>
               <h3>Traditional/Conventional Meditation Styles</h3>
               <section>
                  <h4>Pranayam/Breath Control</h4>
                  <p>
                     After all this, I started researching meditation styles. Many people in the West - certainly the people I grew up around - 
                     picture someone with their legs crossed, fingers in that position (the shape of "f" in ASL), repeating "Ohm". This is one way someone could
                     meditate. However, my personal favorite of the tradtional styles is called <em>"Pranayam"</em> in Hinduism. In layman's terms, this form
                     is about following the breath. Another of my favorite teachers - Thich Nhat Hanh - taught me this method with simple terminology: "Breathing in,
                     I am aware that I am breathing in", and "Breathing out, I am aware that I am breathing out". This is from his book, <em>You Are Here</em>.

               <section>
                  <h4>Transcendental Meditation&reg</h4>
                  <p>
                     This meditation method was popularized in the USA in the late 60's and early 70's by the Beatles. They were taught this method by Maharashi 
                     Mahesh Yogi on their visit to India. Transcendental Meditation is actually an entire movement. The act itself has been considered religious
                     in the United States and is, therefore, not taught in public schools.

                  <p id="return-to-2">
                     The full wikipedia page is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation_technique">here</a>, I mostly wish
                     to talk briefly about this style, as I have only a passing commitment to it. The main concept is the use of a mantra for 15-20
                     minutes multiple times a day. A <strong>Mantra</strong> is a phrase used repatedly in meditation to focus the mind on a simple
                     concept. My favorite Mantra is <em>"I am Loving Awareness"</em><a href="#mantra-owner">[2]</a>, because I feel it works on multiple levels - I am awareness, rather
                     than an individual personality, I am loving, and I am loving my awareness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The way I specifically use this form of meditation, or perhaps a derived version, is repeating a positive mantra, and focusing my energy on that
                     concept. If a thought comes in, the goal is to let that thought dissapate and then return our thinking to the mantra. I use that behavior in Pranayam
                     as well. TM allows us to let our thoughts go gently, not being hard on ourselves if we get distracted. Once we see a thought, we allow that it exists,
                     but we move back to following our mantra, or with breathing I come back to following my breath.

                  <h3>Hobbies Can be Meditation</h3>
                  <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.946c841cb35b1cf64601fb5f5db25156?rik=eWFc%2fyHX0NCplw&riu=http%3a%2f%2f4.bp.blogspot.com%2f-TNY_o5HOCiI%2fUqlvLw5rIlI%2fAAAAAAAAlmA%2fepVleMw1ss8%2fs1600%2f03.jpg&ehk=EZQLSbl6RS7UOCoB1%2bcsSU6qTd2lfUKW8dO2dVvBkDU%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="sand-mandala">

                     at completion. I usually keep my art, but impermanence and all that.
                  </figcaption>
                  <p>
                     Just because art might not be created during a long-standing Buddhist Monastic tradition, that doesn't mean it can't be meditation.
                     My friend Charleigh creates <strong>beautiful, highly realistic art</strong> and the world is better for that fact. I only recently learned,
                     however, that while she is painting her mind is reportedly blank. Visual art is not like that for me, it comes from a very unhappy, thought-filled
                     part of me. Piano and guitar, however, are meditative for me. Meditation isn't just sitting and focusing on doing nothing. Meditation is about <span>not being
                     stuck in your mind, feeling trapped by thoughts.</span> If painting clears your mind enough to relax and take a break from your chaotic thoughts,
                     then you already have a meditation style. No gatekeeping should be done on meditation. There should never be a perceived "right way" to meditate.
                     However you get free from your thoughts, and remember to <strong>take breaks from trying to fix yourself and the world</strong>, that is the perfect
                     method, and the "right way to meditate".

                  <h3>Making Meditation</h3>
                  <p>
                     When I first started meditating, I was out of my element. I had been put on a project building steel frames for stock at a Sam's Club, and had
                     to break my normal sleep schedule in order to do that work. I was working long hours and didn't see a lot of friends. I found, however, that after
                     building the racks, during the period where I silently moved stock from one place to another, my mind was incredibly quiet. When I told my
                     friend, Seth, they said "meditation isn't anything specific, there's no right way to meditate", and I learned to bring meditation into the
                     constant acts of work and play.                     
                  </p>
                  <h4>It's up to you</h4>
                  <p>Beyond your hobbies, beyond the committed practice, there is a state of mind that is meditative. It is believed by many in the field of study
                     I find myself in with meditation, that the purpose of this act is not to take a break from everything and meditate now and again. The purpose,
                     rather, is to come into a state of being - a place in our mind's functioning - that is meditative at all times. A state of equanimity and compassion
                     that is neither stuck entirely in the thoughts of the mind, nor completely dissociated from normal life. Who's to say? All I can say is that meditation
                     has helped me greatly, and taking a moment to do it makes the rest of my day more bearable.
